A template for a REST application. 

Use this project as a template to quickly get started with:

* Jersey (for JAX-RS REST support)
* Spring (IoC container)
* Spring Security (authentication and authorization)
* Logback (logging)
* Jackson (JSON marshalling)
* Bootstrap (nice CSS)
* AngularJS (Javascript one-page application)

Good starting points:

* WebConfig - the main Spring configuration
* MyUserDetailsService - to add roles, privileges, limit what users can authenticate
* SampleResource - an example resource that includes resources requiring authentication & authorization
* angular.html - the only html page
* controllers.js - a basic angular controller

Notice that this project is not intended to show best practices, 
but only to get all the parts of a minimal application working together.
